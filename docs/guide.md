# Lawn Agent — Guide

_Updated April 23, 2026._

## What's live

Visit [lawnagent.app](https://lawnagent.app).

The landing page has five sections: hero, an example proposal card, how it works, a human section, and an email capture. Primary CTA goes to onboarding. A sign-in link below the CTA takes returning users to `/signin`.

Onboarding is built end-to-end. After completing onboarding, users land on the dashboard — which shows their current proposal and inferred yard profile. Onboarding is a one-way door: authenticated users with an existing property are redirected to `/dashboard`.

Sign-in and full password reset are live.

## Getting started (new user)

1. Go to [lawnagent.app](https://lawnagent.app)
2. Click **I want a better yard**
3. Enter your zip code and see a generated proposal

---

## Returning user sign-in

1. Click **Sign in** on the landing page or go to [lawnagent.app/signin](https://lawnagent.app/signin)
2. Enter email and password
3. Forgot password → `/forgot-password` → enter email → check inbox → `/reset-password?token=…` → set new password

---

## Onboarding flow

1. `/onboarding` — Enter zip code
2. Proposal generated via `/api/onboarding/proposal` (zone lookup + live weather/soil data + Claude) — every generation writes an anonymous row to `proposal_telemetry` (zip, zone, category, title). No PII, no user FK.
3. Approve → create account → `/api/onboarding/complete` writes property, yard attributes, and proposal to DB → profile reveal. Outcome (`approved`) written to `proposal_telemetry`.
4. Pass → outcome (`passed`) written to `proposal_telemetry` → optional email capture → back to landing page. Null outcome = bounced before action was captured.

---

## Dashboard

After onboarding, authenticated users land on `/dashboard`. Shows:

- Current proposal (zone label, title, summary, timing, product suggestion as Amazon search link)
- "I did this" button — marks the proposal `done`, logs a `complete` interaction, flips card to confirmation state
- Yard attributes (hardiness zone, grass type, soil type) with contextual sublabels — Claude writes a one-sentence sublabel per attribute tailored to the specific zone and season. Falls back to static confidence labels if not available.
